# 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges faced by subscription-based businesses. When customers leave a service, it directly impacts **revenue, profitability, and long-term growth**.

This project demonstrates a **complete end-to-end churn analytics pipeline**, combining:

- SQL Server for ETL and data processing
- Power BI for business intelligence dashboards
- Python & Machine Learning for churn prediction

The goal is to **identify customers at risk of leaving and generate actionable insights** that help businesses improve customer retention.

---

# 🎯 Business Problem

Companies must answer critical questions such as:

- Which customers are most likely to churn?
- What factors influence churn behavior?
- How can businesses reduce churn and retain customers?

This project addresses these questions using **data analytics and predictive modeling**.

---

# 🎯 Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

✔ Build a **complete ETL pipeline using SQL Server**  
✔ Analyze customer behavior using **Power BI dashboards**  
✔ Identify **key churn drivers**  
✔ Develop a **Machine Learning model to predict churn**  
✔ Enable **data-driven marketing strategies**

---

# 👥 Target Audience

Although the dataset represents a **telecom company**, the techniques used in this project are applicable to many industries:

- Telecom
- Banking & Finance
- E-commerce
- Retail
- Healthcare
- Subscription businesses

Any organization focused on **customer retention** can benefit from churn analytics.

# ⚙️ STEP 1 — ETL Process Using SQL Server

The project begins with building a **data pipeline using SQL Server**.

### Database Creation

```sql
CREATE DATABASE db_Churn
```

### Data Import

Customer data from a CSV file is imported into a staging table.

```
stg_Churn
```

---

### Data Exploration

Example query:

```sql
SELECT Gender, Count(Gender) as TotalCount
FROM stg_Churn
GROUP BY Gender
```

---

### Handling Missing Values

Example:

```sql
ISNULL(Value_Deal, 'None')
ISNULL(Online_Security, 'No')
```

---

### Production Table Creation

Cleaned data is inserted into the production table:

```
prod_Churn
```

---

### Power BI Views

```
vw_ChurnData
vw_JoinData
```

---

# 📊 STEP 2 — Power BI Data Transformation

New columns created:

**Churn Status**

```
if Customer_Status = "Churned" then 1 else 0
```

**Monthly Charge Range**

```
< 20
20 - 50
50 - 100
> 100
```

---

### Mapping Tables

**Age Group**

```
< 20
20 – 35
36 – 50
> 50
```

**Tenure Group**

```
< 6 Months
6-12 Months
12-18 Months
18-24 Months
>= 24 Months
```

---

# 📏 STEP 3 — Power BI Measures

```
Total Customers = COUNT(prod_Churn[Customer_ID])

New Joiners = CALCULATE(COUNT(prod_Churn[Customer_ID]), prod_Churn[Customer_Status]="Joined")

Total Churn = SUM(prod_Churn[Churn Status])

Churn Rate = Total Churn / Total Customers
```

---

# 📊 STEP 4 — Power BI Dashboard

Executive summary dashboard includes:

### KPIs

- Total Customers
- New Joiners
- Total Churn
- Churn Rate

### Demographics

- Gender churn rate
- Age group churn rate

### Account Information

- Payment method churn
- Contract churn
- Tenure churn

### Geographic Analysis

- State-level churn

### Service Analysis

- Internet service usage
- Streaming services

---

# 🤖 STEP 5 — Machine Learning Model

A **Random Forest Classifier** was used to predict churn.

### Why Random Forest?

Random Forest combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
